// Refuses to tag a release unless Integration is green on the exact commit being

// do both by hand.
//
// 2.7.0 deleted the pre-4.3 contextMenuFeature branch as "unreachable dead
// code". The v3.7.0 job in the test matrix caught it immediately and failed with
// `"Launch MSA view" not found in context menu` -- and 2.7.1 was tagged anyway,
// because nightly was red in the same run for an unrelated reason, so a true
// positive read as ambient noise. v3.7.0 hosts lost the menu item for a week.
//
// Every other preversion step checks the working tree. This is the only one that
// checks whether anything has actually run the tests on it.
//
// The commit it pushes is the one `pnpm version` is about to tag anyway --
// postversion pushes it either way, so waiting here only moves that push earlier
// and buys the matrix result before the tag exists rather than after.
//
// CI_WAIT_MINUTES=0 restores the old behaviour: report the current state and
// exit, never push, never wait.
//
// Escape hatch: ALLOW_RED_CI=1 pnpm version patch
